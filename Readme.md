# Min-VM : Small virtual machine

This repo contains the virtual machine that runs min bytecode.It runs the hello world sample in
samples/hello_world.mx.

## Assemble a .min file
If you want for whatever reason to compile some min assembly, you can use the compiler [here](https://github.com/SiD3W4y/min-cc)

## Note 
Only a minimal subset of the opcodes was implemented here so ToDo : Implement other ops
